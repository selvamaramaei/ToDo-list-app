# TODO APP

This is a simple Todo App project that allows you to manage your tasks. You can add new tasks, mark them as completed, edit task names, and filter tasks based on their status. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with some additional styling from Bootstrap and Font Awesome.
